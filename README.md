# MRT-Environment-Script
This repository contains a script that prepares the enviroment for the MRT lecture hands-on activities.
  
  1. Install OpenSUSE, Debian, Mint or Ubuntu natively or on a virtual machine.
  2. Download ftp://eatplt02.et.tu-dresden.de/lectures/MRT/PLT_MRT_Eclipse_RPi_Installer_Lin.tar.gz
  3. Unzip the archive using a graphical tool (eg ark) or run 'tar zfg PLT_MRT_Eclipse_RPi_Installer_Lin.tar.gz' from a shell in the download directory
  4. Start the script with the command `./setup
     Note for debian based distributions:
     You will be asked if you want to use aptitude or apt-get. For Debian, aptitude is recommended. Ubuntu does not install aptitude per default, so apt-get is advised
